# Minecraft server finder

This script will find minecraft servers hosted on ngrok tcp tunnels.

## Quick explanation

Ngrok IPs are basically like this:
0.tcp.sa.ngrok.io:12345

The only thing that changes are the numbers at the end.

The goal of this script is to find ips that are opened and use the [server paster bot](server_paster_bot.py) to add them to minecraft until I find some opened server to join and see people's reactions.

Bruh this must be illegal lol
